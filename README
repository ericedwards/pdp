This is the first released version of my PDP-11 simulator.  I've been running
2.9BSD on it for a while.  It should run on most BSD-like 32-bit Unix machines
with little or no modification.

Compilation Hints:

	check the makefile for compiler paths and options
	look in defines.h for machine dependent stuff
	main.c has some ifdefs to get around stupid compilers

The User Interface:

	e <address>	edit memory
	d <address>	dump memory
	r		register dump
	g [address]	start execution
	s [address]	single step


Feel free to let me know about any bugs, errors, or modifications...  Enjoy!!
